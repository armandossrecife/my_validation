# my_validation

The My_validation replication kit was developed out of the necessity to validate the ATDCodeAnalyzer (https://github.com/mining-software-repositories/cassandra). The concept behind it is to employ SATD (Self-Admitted Technical Debt) instances recorded in commits and issues to verify if Critical Files (identified by the ATDCodeAnalyzer) are present in issues associated with SATD, and whether these issues indicate architectural and technical problems.

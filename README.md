# my_validation

The My_validation replication kit was developed out of the necessity to validate the ATDCodeAnalyzer (https://github.com/mining-software-repositories/cassandra). The concept behind it is to employ SATD (Self-Admitted Technical Debt) instances recorded in commits and issues to verify if Critical Files (identified by the ATDCodeAnalyzer) are present in issues associated with SATD, and whether these issues indicate architectural and technical problems.

Here, you will find the following files:

**My_Commits_and_my_Issues_from_Cassandra.ipynb** - A Google Colab notebook that contains all Python scripts, methods, and datasets required to validate the ATDCodeAnalyzer method.

**commits_com_muitos_arquivos_moficiados.xlsx** - A spreadsheet containing remarkable commits with many modified files and many lines modified per commit. 

**inspecao_completa.xlsx** - A spreadsheet containing the results of inspections.

**inspection_process.md** - A markdown file that provides an explanation of the inspection process assisted by ChatGPT.

**my_inspection.zip** - A zip file containing all issues to be inspected.

**my_issues.zip** - A zip file that holds the results of the inspection for checking architectural issues and technical debt."

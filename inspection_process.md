# Inspection process aided by ChatGTP

We utilized the ChatGPT tool, implementing Few-shot and Chain-of-thought prompting strategies, to expedite the manual inspection of each issue and identify architectural problems. This decision to employ the tool was aimed at streamlining our inspection process.

As a Software Developer, we created a classifier of issues from Issue Tracker Apache Cassandra. We followed the five steps below: 

Is this step we use the following five stages to use the ChatGTP: 

# Stage 1 - Introduction:

We start with an introduction to Architectural Technical Debt (ATD) and Self-admitted Technical Debt (SATD), explaing the concepts, techniques, and types of ATD, providing examples. We discuss different issue types in Jira Cassandra and introduce Apache Cassandra. We also share examples of SATD keywords in commits, including their presence in messages and differences in modified files, as well as in Cassandra issue fields such as summary, description, and comments.

You can see the following prompts: S1P1..S1P4

## Prompt1 (S1P1): 
```bash
Lets talk about the following topics: Architectural Technical Debt (ATD) and Self-admitted Technical Debt (SATD).
```
## Answer1 (S1A1): 
```bash
Certainly! Let's discuss Architectural Technical Debt (ATD) and Self-admitted Technical Debt (SATD) in the context of software development.
Architectural Technical Debt (ATD):
Architectural Technical Debt refers to the issues and problems that arise from architectural decisions made during the software development process. These decisions can include the choice of frameworks, libraries, and design patterns, as well as the overall structure and organization of the codebase. ATD can accumulate over time and hinder the maintainability and scalability of a software system. Some key points about ATD:
Causes: ATD can result from time and budget constraints, lack of expertise, or simply making suboptimal architectural choices.
Effects: It can lead to increased development and maintenance costs, decreased system stability, and slower feature delivery.
Mitigation: To address ATD, teams should regularly assess the architecture, refactor when necessary, and allocate resources to address architectural issues as they arise.
Self-admitted Technical Debt (SATD):
Self-admitted Technical Debt, as the name suggests, is a type of technical debt that developers themselves acknowledge within the codebase. It is essentially a way of flagging issues or suboptimal code, often through comments or annotations within the code. Key points about SATD:
Identification: SATD is typically identified by developers who explicitly document that certain code sections, functions, or components are not up to the desired standard or need improvement.
Examples: SATD can be in the form of comments like "TODO," "FIXME," or "Refactor," indicating that the code in question requires attention.
Advantages: While SATD represents a debt, it can also serve as a helpful mechanism for tracking and managing technical debt, as it highlights areas that need improvement.
In practice, managing both ATD and SATD is crucial for maintaining a healthy and sustainable software development process. Regularly addressing architectural technical debt helps ensure the long-term stability and scalability of a software system, while self-admitted technical debt can serve as a practical reminder for developers to revisit and improve problematic code sections. However, it's essential to have processes in place for addressing both types of technical debt to prevent it from accumulating and negatively impacting a project's success.
```

## Prompt2 (S1P2): 
```bash
Another important topic that could be usefull and related to ATD and SATD is save Tasks or Issues in Issue Tracker System, because it can keep a history of all tasks about improvement, bug-fix, and new features implemented in the software system. Generally, a issue has important data like issue_id, summary, description and comments that contains a lot of important information about improvement taks, bug-fix task or new feature task to help developers to work in the issues.
```

## Answer2 (S1A2): 
```bash
You're absolutely right; using an Issue Tracker System is a crucial component in managing both Architectural Technical Debt (ATD) and Self-admitted Technical Debt (SATD), as well as tracking the progress of various tasks and improvements in a software project. Here's how it's related and its importance:

Task and Issue Tracking:
An Issue Tracker System (or Issue Tracking System) is a central hub for managing and tracking tasks, issues, bug fixes, and feature requests. It provides a structured way to record, organize, and monitor the work that needs to be done. Each issue typically includes:
Issue ID: A unique identifier for the issue.
Summary: A concise title or description of the issue.
Description: Detailed information about the issue, often including context, steps to reproduce, and expected behavior.
Comments: A history of interactions, discussions, and updates related to the issue.
Managing ATD:

Issue trackers are valuable for managing Architectural Technical Debt. When architectural problems or decisions lead to technical debt, these issues can be logged in the tracker. For example, issues related to suboptimal architecture can be created, and the team can prioritize and plan for architectural improvements. Over time, this helps to ensure that architectural issues are acknowledged and addressed.

Addressing SATD:
Self-admitted Technical Debt can also be recorded as issues in the tracker. When a developer identifies problematic code or architectural flaws and adds comments such as "TODO" or "Refactor," these comments can be translated into issues. This formalizes the need for improvement and provides a traceable path for addressing SATD.

Progress Tracking:
An Issue Tracker System allows teams to track the status of each issue, assign responsibility, set priorities, and estimate the effort required for resolution. This helps in effectively managing the technical debt and ensures that improvements are not forgotten or left unattended.

Historical Record:
Issue trackers create a historical record of all tasks, improvements, bug fixes, and feature requests. This record is valuable for tracking changes over time, understanding the evolution of the software, and reviewing past decisions.

Collaboration:
Issue trackers facilitate collaboration and communication among team members. Developers can discuss issues, share insights, and document solutions or workarounds.

Data-Driven Decision Making:
The data generated by an issue tracker can be used for data-driven decision-making, helping teams allocate resources effectively and prioritize work based on the project's needs.

In summary, an Issue Tracker System is an indispensable tool for managing technical debt, tracking improvements, and maintaining an organized and efficient software development process. It helps teams prioritize tasks, keep a historical record, and collaborate effectively, ensuring that ATD and SATD are addressed and that the software evolves in a controlled and well-documented manner.
```

## Prompt3 (S1P3): 
```bash
Here, we can see a set of SATD keywords found in the content of message commits, modified files diff in commits, and issue content from the issue tracker. These kinds of SATD keywords show technical debt in the item that the developer registers the keyword. Here are some of examples of SATD keywords:
API
FIXME
TODO
ability to evolve
ability to handle increased load
annotation
anti-pattern
...
```

## Answer3 (S1A3): 
```bash
The list of SATD keywords you provided is quite extensive and covers a wide range of issues and areas where technical debt can accumulate in software projects. Developers often use these keywords to flag areas that require improvement, refactoring, or attention. Here are a few key points about these SATD keywords:

Diverse Range of Issues: The list includes keywords related to code quality, architectural issues, design flaws, documentation, performance problems, testing, and various other aspects of software development. This diversity highlights the multifaceted nature of technical debt.

Documentation: Several keywords indicate the importance of proper documentation, such as "lack of documentation," "documentation debt," and "documentation doesn't match." Insufficient or outdated documentation can be a significant source of technical debt.

Code Smells: Keywords like "code smell" and "design smell" are used to flag areas where the codebase might not adhere to best practices or could benefit from refactoring. Identifying and addressing code smells is crucial for maintaining code quality.

Testing Debt: Phrases like "no longer needed," "not used," or "no unit test" indicate the need for testing and test coverage improvements. Inadequate test coverage can lead to technical debt related to reliability and maintainability.

Performance and Scalability: Terms like "performance," "scalability issue," and "inefficient solution" draw attention to areas where the software may not meet performance expectations. These issues can accumulate technical debt in terms of system efficiency and responsiveness.

Architectural and Design Debt: Keywords like "architectural debt" and "design flaw" highlight that architectural and design decisions can contribute to technical debt. These decisions should be revisited to ensure long-term maintainability and scalability.

Communication: Some SATD keywords, such as "poorly documented code" or "spurious error messages," underscore the importance of clear communication and user-friendly error handling in software development.

Prioritization: Developers and teams can use these keywords to prioritize and plan their work. Issues marked with these keywords should be addressed over time to reduce technical debt.

Continuous Improvement: Regularly addressing issues tagged with these keywords is part of a continuous improvement process in software development. It helps prevent the accumulation of technical debt and keeps the codebase in good shape.

In practice, using SATD keywords in code comments or within an Issue Tracker System, as mentioned earlier, is an effective way to track and manage technical debt, ensuring that it doesn't impede the progress of the software project and that code quality is maintained over time.

## Prompt4 (S1P4):
```bash
Here, we can see an example of issue from Jira Apache Cassandra, that contains issue_type, summary, description and comments: 
issue_type: Improvement 
summary: Added support for type VECTOR<type, dimension> 
description: Based off several mailing list threads (see "[POLL] Vector type for ML”, "[DISCUSS] New data type for vector search”, and "Adding vector search to SAI with heirarchical navigable small world graph index”), its desirable to add a new type “VECTOR” that has the following properties

1) fixed length array
2) elements may not be null
3) flatten array (aka multi-cell = false) 
status: Resolved 
comments: having a hard time fixing CQL3TypeLiteralTest as this test never tested what CQL supports, but tests against a model generated by a human... when you fix bugs in toCQLLiteral so it actually works in CQL, this test breaks... and is breaking in annoying ways... one way is that UDT does not allow NULL for a counter type, but this test makes sure we convert it to "name: null"... there have been a lot more... so will take time to fix this test... its also kinda the same as the new AbstractTypeTest.serde as it tests the same behavior, but uses CQL parsing to validate
A note on the serialization format: right now we're serializing vectors as just a sequence of the underlying subtypes.  So if we have a vector of floats of dimension 3 we just write three serialized floats one after another on the wire; there's no size information included for either the number of elements in the list or the size of any one element.  This differs from how other collections (such as lists and maps) and UDTs are handled.  In those cases we send along (a) the element size of a given collection and (b) the size of each element (included in the bytes structure).

Such a change isn't unreasonable, at least not for fixed size types (and perhaps the variable types as well) since hypothetically the codecs should be aware of how big a given type might be.  But that's not what, say, the Java driver does at the moment.  Let's take the example of a float type; when decoding a ByteBuffer expected to contain an instance of this type we expect that ByteBuffer to contain precisely four bytes.  The assumption is that something upstream has pulled off exactly the expected number of bytes from some larger ByteBuffer.

I certainly can take steps to expose the expected number of bytes for a given codec.  But it did seem worthwhile to highlight the difference and make sure that this difference in serialization formats represents an explicit choice.
bq. But it did seem worthwhile to highlight the difference and make sure that this difference in serialization formats represents an explicit choice.

Yes, this was something I explicitly did.  My argument was that the common case are vectors of numbers, so by optimizing for this case we save a lot of space for these vectors (vector<byte, 1024> is 1,024 bytes with this format, but would have been 5,120 if we included size).  This gets even worse if you move from a vector to a matrix (vector<vector<byte, 1024>, 1024> would be 1,048,576 bytes without the header and 20,971,520 with the header); notice that in this case vector is fixed length if-and-only-if the element type is fixed length!

One added change I have been thinking about is "fixing" ShortType to be fixed length in this code path without changing existing code paths... right now ShortType is serialized as int header + 2 byte short in vector type, but also in normal SSTable format!  Its actually cheaper for users to store a short as an int as that is stored as 4 bytes only... Given this is a new type, I could add and use a new method "valueLengthIfFixedNoForRealThisTime" and only fix ShortType to return 2 where as valueLengthIfFixed currently returns -1 (aka not fixed length)...
just pushed a patch that breaks AbstractTypeTest as I added support for CompositeType and found a fun bug where using this may corrupt the DB's in-memory state (if set<'CompositeType(...)'> is seen before set< bytes> is seen, then ordering breaks in org.apache.cassandra.serializers.SetSerializer#serializeValues... adding a test to detect this type of bug also found the same issue with LexicalUUIDType and uuid, which can corrupt ordering as well...
all types are now generated using the type builder
TIL: tinyint is variable length and not fixed length...
just found out about org.apache.cassandra.cql3.functions.types.DataType... not sure why we have duplicate logic for types yet, so need to figure out...
spoke with [~adelapena] and we are going to block vectors from being reachable fr
```

The comments section, in particular, allows for in-depth discussions and collaboration among contributors to ensure that the proposed improvement is well-understood and implemented effectively.
```

# Stage 2 - Example Showcase:

We provide showcase a few sample issues (ten issues about task, bug-fix, improvement, and new feature) that have been converted into .txt files. These files contain issue-specific information, including issue ID, type, status, summary, description, and comments. We also mentioned that these issues have already undergone manual inspections without ChatGPT.

You can see the following prompts: S2P1..S2Pk

## Prompt5 (S2P1)
```bash
Here you can see an Bug issue:
issue_type: Bug 
summary: Reuse of metadata collector can break key count calculation 
description: When flushing a memtable we currently pass a constructed {{MetadataCollector}} to the {{SSTableMultiWriter}} that is used for writing sstables. The latter may decide to split the data into multiple sstables (e.g. for separate disks or driven by compaction strategy) — if it does so, the cardinality estimation component in the reused {{MetadataCollector}} for each individual sstable contains the data for all of them.

As a result, when such sstables are compacted the estimation for the number of keys in the resulting sstables, which is used to determine the size of the bloom filter for the compaction result, is heavily overestimated.

This results in much bigger L1 bloom filters than they should be. One example (which came about during testing of the upcoming CEP-26, after insertion of 100GB data with 10% reads):
(current)
{code}
 		Bloom filter false positives: 22627369
 		Bloom filter false ratio: 0.02257
 		Bloom filter space used: 1848247864
 		Bloom filter off heap memory  
status: Open 
comments: I don't think this affects any of our current {{SSTableMultiWriter}} implementations right? {{RangeAwareSSTableWriter}} creates a new collector for every new sstable and {{SimpleSSTableMultiWriter}} only creates a single new sstable.
You are right, this currently isn't a problem here, only something to be aware of and fix / work around when a compaction strategy needs to split the flush output.

I was thinking per-disk splitting on flush can trigger this, but that's handled inside the flushing code rather than in the writer.
```

## Answer5 (S2A5):
```bash
This is an example of a bug issue in the context of a software development project. Let's break down the key information within this bug issue:

Issue Type: The issue is classified as a "Bug," which indicates that it represents an unexpected or unintended behavior in the software.

Summary: The summary provides a brief description of the bug. In this case, it relates to a problem with the reuse of a metadata collector, which can result in an incorrect key count calculation.

Description: The description provides a more detailed explanation of the bug. It describes the scenario where a metadata collector is reused during the flushing of a memtable. However, if the data is split into multiple SSTables, the cardinality estimation component within the reused metadata collector accumulates data from all of them. This leads to overestimated key counts when compacting these SSTables.

Status: The status of the issue is "Open," indicating that it has been identified but not yet resolved.

Comments: The comments section contains a discussion related to the bug. Contributors discuss the impact of the bug and its relevance to different implementations of SSTable writers. They acknowledge that this bug might not affect the current implementations but highlight that it's something to be aware of and potentially fix when a compaction strategy necessitates splitting the flush output.

In software development, bug issues like this one are essential to maintain the quality and reliability of the software. Issue trackers help developers identify, track, and address such problems, and the comments section allows for collaborative discussions on how to resolve the issue. The status "Open" indicates that the bug is acknowledged, and the development team will work on a solution to fix it.
```

## Prompt6 (S2P2)
```bash
Here you can see an improvement issue: 
issue_type: Improvement 
summary: Include estimated active compaction remaining write size when starting a new compaction 
description: There are a few things we can augment in how we handle compactions locally to improve upon the very simple "keep X Mebibytes free on disk" we currently have:
 Allow specification of free space available in percent rather than raw size
 Do this on a per-disk basis based on what's going on with compactions
 Include an estimate of the disk space of active compactions in flight when we do the above calculation check so we don't blow past our limits due to concurrent runs

```

## Prompt7 (S2P7)
```bash
Here you can see an New Feature Issue:
issue_type: New Feature 
summary: On-disk string index with index building and on-disk query path 
description: An on-disk index for string (literal) datatypes. This index is used for the following datatypes:
 * UTF8Type
 * AsciiType
 * CompositeType
 * Frozen types

This includes the ability to write the index to disk at index creation, by specific index rebuild and during SSTable compaction. 

Also the ability to query the on-disk index and combine the results with those from the in-memory indexes created by CASSANDRA-18058. 
status: Resolved 
comments: The PR for this patch is here: https://github.com/maedhroz/cassandra/pull/9
Minor note: I had forgotten to actually push the trunk rebase for the CASSANDRA-16052 feature branch on the 19th. That's done, so the branch here will need a quick rebase.
I have rebased the CASSANDRA-18062 against the rebased CASSANDRA-16052 branch.
[~mfleming] Just to be clear, this is almost certainly not going to land in any 4.x release, and if [~mike_tr_adamson] is okay w/ it, I’d suggest we just use the NA version here and later inherit the main CEP-7 version when that’s finalized in the epic Jira/ticket.
[~maedhroz] Sure can do. I was just monkeying about with the versions to create a simpler kanban board, but I'm happy to use NA here.
[~mike_tr_adamson] [~adelapena] I've thrown my +1 on the PR

There are a number of Jiras we've agreed to spin off and handle separately, so modulo getting those created and making sure we're clean on tests (I can rebase if we have things failing because of trunk divergence...let me know), things are looking pretty good here.
Changes look good to me too, I have only left a few final nits on the PR.

As for testing, there are too many modified files for the automatic CircleCI repeated runs but I can start a few runs repeating the modified tests in batches. It might be preferable to do so after rebase, if we are going to rebase now.
This is the latest test run on [CircleCI|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/mike-tr-adamson/cassandra/129/workflows/ffae16e7-9b23-42ef-8d6f-f47aafcb6a4b]. The failures seem unrelated to SAI so I don't whether rebase first of merge first. I'm happy with either.
Just reviewed the last clean-up commit.

+1 overall

Let's squash it, fix up the commit message, and merge this thing!

Once it's merged, I'll rebase the 16052 branch, run the tests, and report back.
I think we should run the repeated tests before merging, so we make sure we don't introduce new flakies.

I have started part of the repeated runs [here|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra?branch=18062-trunk-test]. Each push on that branch is for running a subset of the new or modified tests.

So far it has hit test failures on [{{StorageAttachedIndexDDLTest.concurrentTruncateWithIndexBuilding}}|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/2835/workflows/8301fcae-ab73-401d-ae26-d3e7e8b0f237/jobs/38519/tests] and [{{CompactionTest.testConcurrentIndexDropWithCompaction}}|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/2828/workflows/c22d9dc8-9af1-493f-9e13-e91631fd2386/jobs/38538/tests]. I'll keep running the rest of the tests to see if there are more flakies.
Even if we do have a couple flakes, they're only merging to the 16052 umbrella branch, where I'd be running the repeats again after the next trunk rebase. If they're trivial to resolve now before merge though, that's fine too.
These are the new flaky tests once all the CI runs have finished:

```bash
## Instructions ###
"Architectural impact" in software systems is the effect that design decisions made at the architectural level have on the system's overall quality attributes, such as performance, scalability, maintainability, security, and reliability.

Architectural impact can be both positive and negative. For example, a decision to use a microservices architecture can improve the system's scalability and maintainability, but it can also increase the system's complexity and make it more difficult to debug.

Here are some specific examples of architectural impact:

A decision to use a distributed architecture can improve the system's scalability and performance, but it can also increase the system's complexity and make it more difficult to manage.
A decision to use a layered architecture can improve the system's maintainability and security, but it can also reduce the system's performance.
A decision to use a cloud-based architecture can reduce the cost and complexity of managing the system, but it can also make the system more vulnerable to attack.
```

## Answer8 (S2A8):
```bash
You've provided excellent examples of architectural impact in software systems. Let's explore each of them in more detail:

Distributed Architecture:

Positive Impact: Improved scalability and performance. A distributed architecture allows the system to handle a larger number of requests and process data more efficiently by distributing the workload across multiple servers or nodes.
Negative Impact: Increased complexity and management challenges. Managing a distributed system can be more complex due to issues like network communication, data consistency, and fault tolerance. Debugging and monitoring become more challenging.
Layered Architecture:

Positive Impact: Enhanced maintainability and security. A layered architecture separates the system into distinct layers, making it easier to manage and maintain. Each layer has a specific responsibility, simplifying updates and reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities.
Negative Impact: Reduced performance. The separation of layers can introduce overhead in terms of data transfer and processing, potentially affecting system performance. However, the impact on performance may vary depending on the architecture's specific design.
Cloud-Based Architecture:

Positive Impact: Reduced cost and complexity. Utilizing cloud services can lower infrastructure costs and simplify system management. Cloud providers handle tasks like hardware maintenance and scaling, allowing developers to focus on application logic.
Negative Impact: Increased vulnerability to attacks. Relying on external cloud services can expose the system to potential security risks, such as data breaches or service outages. It's crucial to implement strong security measures and follow best practices.
These examples demonstrate that architectural decisions have far-reaching consequences on various quality attributes of a software system. When making architectural choices, it's important to consider the trade-offs and carefully assess how they align with the project's goals and requirements. Ultimately, architectural impact analysis is an integral part of designing robust and effective software systems.
```

## Prompt 9 (S2P9)
```bash
Here are some other examples of architectural impacts in software systems:
Performance: The choice of programming language, database, and other technologies can have a significant impact on the performance of a software system. For example, a system written in a compiled language such as C++ will generally perform better than a system written in an interpreted language such as Python.
Scalability: The ability of a system to handle increased load is another important quality attribute. Some architectural decisions, such as using a distributed architecture or a cloud-based architecture, can improve the scalability of a system.
Maintainability: The ease with which a system can be modified and extended is also important. Some architectural decisions, such as using a layered architecture or a modular architecture, can improve the maintainability of a system.
Security: The ability of a system to protect itself from attack is another important quality attribute. Some architectural decisions, such as using a layered architecture or a least-privilege approach, can improve the security of a system.
Reliability: The ability of a system to operate correctly over time is also important. Some architectural decisions, such as using fault tolerance and redundancy techniques, can improve the reliability of a system.

These additional examples of architectural impacts in software systems further highlight the critical role of architectural decisions in shaping a system's overall quality attributes:

Performance:

Positive Impact: The choice of technologies, such as a compiled language like C++, can lead to improved system performance. Compiled languages typically offer faster execution speeds than interpreted languages.
Negative Impact: Opting for an interpreted language like Python may result in slower performance due to the interpretation step during execution. Performance issues can affect response times and user experience.
Scalability:

Positive Impact: Architectural choices like a distributed or cloud-based architecture can enhance a system's scalability. These approaches allow the system to handle increased load by adding more resources as needed.
Negative Impact: Neglecting scalability considerations can lead to bottlenecks and system instability when faced with growing user demands. Inadequate scaling can result in poor user experience and reduced system reliability.
Maintainability:

Positive Impact: Architectural decisions, such as adopting a layered or modular architecture, can make it easier to modify and extend a system. Separation of concerns and clear boundaries between components contribute to improved maintainability.
Negative Impact: Complex, tightly-coupled architectures can hinder maintenance efforts, making it difficult to isolate and update specific parts of the system. Poor maintainability can lead to costly and error-prone development.
Security:

Positive Impact: Security-focused architectural choices, like a layered architecture with strict access controls or a least-privilege approach, can enhance a system's ability to protect itself from attacks. Separating components with different security levels can mitigate vulnerabilities.
Negative Impact: An insecure architectural design, with insufficient access control or unsecured communication between components, can expose the system to security risks. Security breaches can result in data leaks, unauthorized access, or service disruptions.
Reliability:

Positive Impact: Architectural strategies that incorporate fault tolerance and redundancy techniques can improve a system's reliability. Redundant components and failover mechanisms can help the system continue operating correctly in the presence of failures.
Negative Impact: Neglecting reliability considerations can result in system outages, data loss, and unexpected errors. Unforeseen failures can disrupt services and damage the system's reputation.
These examples illustrate how architectural decisions influence key quality attributes of software systems. Developers and architects must carefully assess and balance these impacts to align the architecture with the project's goals and requirements effectively.

### Instructions ###
Based on content discussed previously, let create a classifier for architectural technical debt, we can classify issues to check if they have architectural impact and technical debt in the software, or if they do not have architectural impact and technical debt. Lets see some examples of issues with Architectural Technical Debt and other issues without Architectural Technical Debt.

## Answer10 (S2A10):
```bash
Creating a classifier for architectural technical debt involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques, which can be a complex task. To build such a classifier, you would typically need a labeled dataset of issues or tickets that have been manually categorized as either having architectural technical debt or not having it. Machine learning models, such as text classification models, can be trained on this dataset to automatically classify new issues.

Here's a high-level overview of the steps to create a classifier for architectural technical debt:

Data Collection: Collect a dataset of software issues or tickets from a project's issue tracking system. These issues should include descriptions, summaries, and potentially comments.

Labeling: Manually label the issues as either having architectural technical debt or not having it. This is a time-consuming process but is essential for supervised learning.

Preprocessing: Preprocess the issue text data. This may include text cleaning (removing special characters, punctuation, and lowercasing), tokenization, and stop-word removal.

Feature Extraction: Convert the text data into numerical features that can be used as input to machine learning models. Common techniques include TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec or GloVe).

Model Selection: Choose a suitable machine learning model for text classification. Common models include logistic regression, support vector machines, and more advanced models like deep learning-based models (e.g., neural networks or BERT).

Training: Train the selected model on the labeled dataset, using a portion of the data for training and another portion for validation.

Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters to improve its performance.

Testing: After training and evaluation, test the model on new, unlabeled issues to classify them as having or not having architectural technical debt.

Deployment: Once the model performs well, you can deploy it to automatically classify incoming issues in your issue tracking system.

In practice, implementing this involves programming and data science skills. Additionally, having a substantial and representative dataset for training is crucial to build an effective classifier.

For a more concrete demonstration, you would need access to labeled data and machine learning tools. If you have a specific dataset and want to proceed with a particular tool or library, feel free to ask for more guidance on any of the steps mentioned above.

Creating a classifier for architectural technical debt requires a labeled dataset of issues, where each issue is categorized as either having architectural technical debt or not. With a labeled dataset, you can train a machine learning model to classify new issues. Below are examples of issues for both categories to help you get started:

Issues with Architectural Technical Debt:

Issue Type: Bug

Summary: "Performance degradation observed in the last release."
Description: "After the last release, users have reported significant performance degradation. It seems that the architectural changes we made in the previous release have introduced technical debt that's impacting performance."
Issue Type: Improvement

Summary: "Refactor monolithic code into microservices."
Description: "Our current monolithic architecture is causing scalability and maintainability issues. We need to refactor the codebase into microservices to address architectural technical debt."
Issue Type: Task

Summary: "Address database schema inconsistencies."
Description: "Over time, our database schema has become inconsistent due to ad-hoc changes. This architectural technical debt needs to be addressed to maintain data integrity."
Issue Type: Technical Debt

Summary: "Identify and document architectural technical debt items."
Description: "We need to perform an audit of our software architecture to identify and document areas where architectural technical debt has accumulated. This will help us prioritize future improvements."
Issues without Architectural Technical Debt:

Issue Type: Feature

Summary: "Add user profile picture feature."
Description: "This feature request involves adding the ability for users to upload profile pictures. It does not impact the software's architecture."
Issue Type: Documentation

Summary: "Update user guide with new features."
Description: "This task is about updating the user guide to reflect recent feature additions. It does not involve architectural changes."
Issue Type: Task

Summary: "Fix typo in error message."
Description: "There's a minor typo in one of the error messages. This is a straightforward task that doesn't affect the software's architecture."
Issue Type: Bug

Summary: "Incorrect sorting in search results."
Description: "The search results are not sorting correctly. This is a bug that can be fixed without architectural changes."
You can use these example issues to create a labeled dataset for training your classifier. Each issue should be labeled as either "Architectural Technical Debt" or "No Architectural Technical Debt." Once you have a dataset, you can proceed with preprocessing, feature extraction, model selection, training, evaluation, and deployment as mentioned earlier. If you have any specific questions or need further guidance on any of these steps, please feel free to ask.

status: Resolved 
comments: The PR for this patch is here: https://github.com/maedhroz/cassandra/pull/9
Minor note: I had forgotten to actually push the trunk rebase for the CASSANDRA-16052 feature branch on the 19th. That's done, so the branch here will need a quick rebase.
I have rebased the CASSANDRA-18062 against the rebased CASSANDRA-16052 branch.
[~mfleming] Just to be clear, this is almost certainly not going to land in any 4.x release, and if [~mike_tr_adamson] is okay w/ it, I’d suggest we just use the NA version here and later inherit the main CEP-7 version when that’s finalized in the epic Jira/ticket.
[~maedhroz] Sure can do. I was just monkeying about with the versions to create a simpler kanban board, but I'm happy to use NA here.
[~mike_tr_adamson] [~adelapena] I've thrown my +1 on the PR

There are a number of Jiras we've agreed to spin off and handle separately, so modulo getting those created and making sure we're clean on tests (I can rebase if we have things failing because of trunk divergence...let me know), things are looking pretty good here.
Changes look good to me too, I have only left a few final nits on the PR.

As for testing, there are too many modified files for the automatic CircleCI repeated runs but I can start a few runs repeating the modified tests in batches. It might be preferable to do so after rebase, if we are going to rebase now.
This is the latest test run on [CircleCI|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/mike-tr-adamson/cassandra/129/workflows/ffae16e7-9b23-42ef-8d6f-f47aafcb6a4b]. The failures seem unrelated to SAI so I don't whether rebase first of merge first. I'm happy with either.
Just reviewed the last clean-up commit.

+1 overall

Let's squash it, fix up the commit message, and merge this thing!

Once it's merged, I'll rebase the 16052 branch, run the tests, and report back.
I think we should run the repeated tests before merging, so we make sure we don't introduce new flakies.

I have started part of the repeated runs [here|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra?branch=18062-trunk-test]. Each push on that branch is for running a subset of the new or modified tests.

So far it has hit test failures on [{{StorageAttachedIndexDDLTest.concurrentTruncateWithIndexBuilding}}|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/2835/workflows/8301fcae-ab73-401d-ae26-d3e7e8b0f237/jobs/38519/tests] and [{{CompactionTest.testConcurrentIndexDropWithCompaction}}|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/2828/workflows/c22d9dc8-9af1-493f-9e13-e91631fd2386/jobs/38538/tests]. I'll keep running the rest of the tests to see if there are more flakies.
Even if we do have a couple flakes, they're only merging to the 16052 umbrella branch, where I'd be running the repeats again after the next trunk rebase. If they're trivial to resolve now before merge though, that's fine too.
These are the new flaky tests once all the CI runs have finished:

## Answer11 (S2A11): 
```bash
The issue you provided is an example of an issue with architectural technical debt. It falls under the "New Feature" category but involves architectural changes that impact the software's design. Here are the key indicators that suggest architectural technical debt:

Summary: The summary mentions the creation of an "on-disk string index with index building and on-disk query path." This indicates a significant architectural change.

Description: The description explains the need for an on-disk index for various data types and mentions the ability to write the index to disk at index creation, rebuild it, and use it during SSTable compaction. These activities involve architectural modifications.

Comments: The comments include discussions about merging, rebasing, and running tests. These conversations are typical when addressing architectural changes, as they require careful handling and testing to ensure they don't introduce issues.

In contrast, issues without architectural technical debt are typically straightforward, often related to bug fixes, minor feature additions, documentation updates, or code refactoring that doesn't impact the system's architecture.

For building a classifier, you would need a dataset with labeled issues like this one, indicating whether they involve architectural technical debt or not. With such a dataset, you can train a machine learning model to automatically classify new issues based on their content and context. If you have more examples or specific questions about creating a classifier, please let me know.

```

## Answer12 (S2A12):
```bash
This is another example of an issue with architectural technical debt. The issue type is "Improvement," but the nature of the improvement involves architectural changes and considerations. Here's why this issue can be classified as having architectural technical debt:

Summary: The summary mentions the improvement of including the estimated active compaction remaining write size when starting a new compaction. This indicates that the proposed change is not just a minor improvement but involves architectural considerations.

Description: The description outlines several enhancements related to how compactions are handled locally. These enhancements include allowing the specification of free space in terms of percentages, on a per-disk basis, and considering the disk space of active compactions. These changes have architectural implications, as they affect the overall design and performance of compaction processes.

Comments: The comments include references to a pull request (PR) and CI (Continuous Integration) pipelines. These are typical in scenarios where architectural changes are being proposed, as thorough testing and reviews are necessary to ensure that architectural modifications do not introduce issues.

In contrast, issues without architectural technical debt are typically more straightforward and do not require significant changes to the system's architecture.

Creating a classifier for architectural technical debt would involve using a dataset of labeled issues like this one, indicating whether they involve architectural changes and technical debt. You can then train a machine learning model to automatically classify new issues based on their content and context. If you have more examples or specific questions about creating a classifier, please feel free to ask.

## Prompt13 (S2P13)
```bash
Prompt13: 
Here is another issue with Architectural Technical Debt: 
issue_type: Bug 
summary: Reuse of metadata collector can break key count calculation 
description: When flushing a memtable we currently pass a constructed {{MetadataCollector}} to the {{SSTableMultiWriter}} that is used for writing sstables. The latter may decide to split the data into multiple sstables (e.g. for separate disks or driven by compaction strategy) — if it does so, the cardinality estimation component in the reused {{MetadataCollector}} for each individual sstable contains the data for all of them.

As a result, when such sstables are compacted the estimation for the number of keys in the resulting sstables, which is used to determine the size of the bloom filter for the compaction result, is heavily overestimated.

This results in much bigger L1 bloom filters than they should be. One example (which came about during testing of the upcoming CEP-26, after insertion of 100GB data with 10% reads):
(current)
{code}
 		Bloom filter false positives: 22627369
 		Bloom filter false ratio: 0.02257
 		Bloom filter space used: 1848247864
 		Bloom filter off heap memory  
status: Open 
comments: I don't think this affects any of our current {{SSTableMultiWriter}} implementations right? {{RangeAwareSSTableWriter}} creates a new collector for every new sstable and {{SimpleSSTableMultiWriter}} only creates a single new sstable.
You are right, this currently isn't a problem here, only something to be aware of and fix / work around when a compaction strategy needs to split the flush output.

I was thinking per-disk splitting on flush can trigger this, but that's handled inside the flushing code rather than in the writer.
```

## Answer13 (S2A13):
```bash
This is another example of an issue with architectural technical debt. Let's break down why this issue falls into that category:

Issue Type: The issue type is "Bug." While it's categorized as a bug, the description and comments indicate that it relates to architectural considerations and technical debt in the design.

Summary: The issue summary mentions a problem related to the reuse of metadata collectors that can break key count calculations. This problem has architectural implications, as it's related to how the system handles and processes metadata.

Description: The description explains in detail how the issue affects the system's behavior. It highlights the fact that when flushing a memtable, a constructed MetadataCollector is passed to the SSTableMultiWriter. This reuse of the MetadataCollector causes problems when data is split into multiple SSTables. The issue points out that the cardinality estimation component within the reused MetadataCollector contains data for all of the split SSTables, leading to overestimated values. This overestimation impacts the size of the bloom filter used in compaction results.

Comments: The comments provide additional context and discussion around the issue. They acknowledge that the problem may not affect all current implementations of SSTableMultiWriter, which implies that this is an architectural issue that needs to be addressed and fixed.

In summary, this issue is an example of architectural technical debt because it highlights a problem in the system's architecture and design that needs to be resolved to maintain system quality and performance.

Here is an example of issue that does not have Architectural Technical Debt:
issue_type: Bug 
summary: Mixed line endings in the codebase 
description: There seems to be a lot of line endings in the codebase that end with DOS line endings. Some files are even mixes of DOS and Unix line endings. This patch removes all the DOS file endings and corrects them to Unix.

Also attached is the program that I used to remove them. 

Using Unix line endings in all places makes lots of things easier. At the very least, a consistent choice of line endings would. Has there been discussion of what should be the correct line ending to use? 
status: Resolved 
comments: This is the patch file to remove the DOS line endings from the code. no.rb is a ruby program that I ran to create this patch.
Oh, and that program is so ugly because I wanted to be sure I was just replacing "\r\n" and not also adding newlines at the ends of files, etc. 
The vast majority of the files use Windows line endings, which makes sense since the original authors develop on Windows.  It makes more sense to me to standardize on that, even though I develop on Linux.
As long as we standardized on one or the other, as long as we set the svn:eol-style to native things should resolve themselves, right?  Windows users see Windows line endings and *X users see *X line endings.
I like the sound of this deep svn voodoo.
The mixed line-endings drove me nuts when developing on Windows. Cygwin made everything worse. None of the eol settings in git would do the right thing. Standardizing on one set of endings would be cause for great joy!
I had no idea that existed.  Will it deal with the few files that have mixed line endings?
I don't think it would handle them properly, although I'm not sure.  You can set individual files to one or the other, or native, but I think you'd have to leave it without an svn:eol-style if you *wanted* to keep it mixed.  It'd be better to convert them first if there's no compelling reason for them to be mixed.

http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch07s02.html#svn-ch-7-sect-2.3.5 is the relevant section of the subversion book.

The algorithm would be:
 - find all files we want to have proper eol's
 - convert them all to your native system's eol's
 - for each filename in files:
 - - svn propset svn:eol-style native filename
 - commit all files

The above is obviously most easily done with a script.

To keep things nice going forward after this is done, if each committer added the following section to their .subversion/config then new files would automatically have the correct eol style set:
[auto-props]
*.java = svn:eol-style=native
*.properties = svn:eol-style=native
*.py= svn:eol-style=native
*.sh = svn:eol-style=native;svn:executable
*.thrift = svn:eol-style=native
*.txt = svn:eol-style=native
*.xml = svn:eol-style=native
I doubt the svn-magic will play well with Git.

Can we switch to Unix endings and be done with it?
The svn-magic plays just fine with Git, git-svn knows about eol-style.  Even so, people not using git-svn and just using git directly would ignore the settings.

Re: Unix endings, yeah, I was suggesting moving to Unix endings.  Settings those styles allows editors and platforms without appropriate eol handling to treat them natively though.
Unix line ending conversion done from code in r797209.

Using this code:

{code}
find . -name "*.java" -print0 -o -name "*.sh" -print0 -o -name "*.xml" -print0 -o -name "*.txt" -print0 | xargs -0 dos2unix
{code}
I don't see anyone that prefers \r\n trying to make this consistent or making noise about wanting consistency. I say the Unix hackers win this one.
Corrected unix line endings patch. Last one was an aborted one that someone was renamed. Apologies.
Since we're seeing more and more mixing of line endings (like in r798935), here is another patch moving cassandra to unix line endings. Patch is against r799140.
with a trunk cassandra-crlf and a patched cassandra-crlf2 this returns no result:
diff -r -w cassandra-crlf cassandra-crlf2

+1 for applying this immediately.  There are no enormous patches in the queue and this doesn't mess with any Windows-specific files.

I still think we should be applying the svn properties and configuration I discuss above, but getting all the files into the correct format is the most important step.

This is an example of an issue that does not have architectural technical debt:

Issue Type: The issue type is "Bug." However, the problem mentioned in this issue is not related to architectural considerations or technical debt in the design. It's a relatively straightforward issue involving line endings in the codebase.

Summary: The issue summary states that there are mixed line endings in the codebase. This problem is about ensuring consistent line endings in the code, which is more of a code style issue rather than an architectural one.

Description: The description explains that there are line endings with DOS line endings (\r\n) in the codebase, and the patch aims to remove the DOS line endings and standardize on Unix line endings (\n). It discusses the benefits of using consistent line endings for ease of development but doesn't delve into architectural issues.

Comments: The comments mainly discuss the process of correcting line endings, setting up Subversion properties for automatic handling, and the preference for Unix line endings. There is no discussion of architectural implications.

In summary, this issue is focused on code style and formatting (line endings) but does not address architectural concerns or technical debt in the software's design.

Here is another example of issue that does not have Architectural Technical Debt
issue_type: New Feature 
summary: Allow selecting Map values and Set elements 
description: Allow "SELECT map['key]" and "SELECT set['key']." 
status: Resolved 
comments: What should we do for "does element X exist in set Y" syntax?
Is this something for CASSANDRA-7395 ?
Want to say: wouldn't it be easier to add some "C*-UDF-stdlib" and implement it there?
The drawback: it would look like {{select stdlib:mapGet( map, 'key' ),  stdlib:listGet( list, 42 ),  stdlib:setContains( set, 'value' )  ...}}
Or add some "operator" functionality to UDF : {{+ - / * !  [x]}}
It's definitively worth having proper syntactic sugar here imo and that's really mainly what this issue is about. We can indeed make this sugar generate a function call behind the scene but we don't need CASSANDRA-7395 per-se to add such function.

Also, ultimately we can and should make those operator be "efficient" (at least for map and sets, for lists there is no much we can do) by not querying the whole CQL row if we don't need to (which amount to extending what CASSANDRA-7085 will introduce) so we'll almost surely end up with having those operation being special cased anyway, not just simple function calls.
It seems to me a natural extension would be extending this to slicing capabilities

map[key1..key2] 

or whatever syntax was appropriate.
bq. It's definitively worth having proper syntactic sugar here

agree

UDFs are not a requirement for this one - but may help to quickly add new functionality with the option to optimize that later (using CASSANDRA-7085, optimized slice queries etc)

bq. slicing capabilities map[key1..key2] 

maybe also to check which keys are present for a slice (or at all) and return these keys

and some "containsKey(key1..key2)" (return a boolean or an int with the count of the existing keys)
Proposal ("map" used for map columns, "set" for set columns, "list" for list columns) :
* {{map\[key]}} to return single map value or {{null}}
* {{map?\[key]}} tests whether single map key exists ({{true}} or {{false}})
* {{map\[key1..key2]}} to return sliced map
* {{map?\[key1..key2]}} to return set with keys that are present in the map
* {{map\[..key2]}} to return sliced map
* {{map?\[..key2]}} to return set with keys that are present in the map
* {{map\[key1..]}} to return sliced map
* {{map?\[key1..]}} to return set with keys that are present in the map
* {{set\[key]}} returns {{true}} or {{false}} whether a single element exists
* {{set\[key1..key2]}} to return sliced set (check values of multiple elements)
* {{set\[key1..]}} to return sliced set (check values of multiple elements)
* {{set\[..key2]}} to return sliced set (check values of multiple elements)
* {{list\[idx]}} to return single list element
* {{list?\[idx]}} tests whether single list element exists ({{true}} or {{false}})
* {{list\[idx1..idx2]}} to return sliced list - list has length {{idx2-idx1+1}}
* {{list?\[idx1..idx2]}} to return sliced list with {{true}} or {{false}} indicating whether an element exists (is no tnull)
* {{sizeof(map)}}, {{sizeof(set)}}, {{sizeof(list)}} to return size of map/set/list

Restriction for {{key1..key2}} : {{key1}} must be less than {{key2}}

Using these collection operations on parts of primary key columns would require special handling.
Primary key columns are stored in their serialized byte representation - so it would need deserialzation, handling, 2nd serialization.

All would be added to {{unaliasedSelector}} in {{Cql.g}}.
Other thoughts?

I've built a POC for slicing (except {{sizeof}} functions) availabile at github at https://github.com/snazy/cassandra/tree/7396-coll-slice to illustrate functionality. 

That POC does not use column slicing to read only the requested values. In fact I do not know how to read only a map key „foobar“ from a table with clustering keys. AFAIK will the "internal column name“ something like "clusteringKey:mapColumnName:mapColumnKey“. Such a read optimization could be done for tables that not not have a clustering key.

But there’s room for optimization to prevent unnecessary internal serialization-deserialization-serialization sequences for the above collection operations by using only

## Answer15 (S2A15): 
```bash
This is an example of an issue that does not have architectural technical debt:

Issue Type: The issue type is "New Feature." It is focused on adding new features or capabilities to the software.

Summary: The issue summary suggests allowing the selection of map values and set elements, which is a feature enhancement rather than a bug fix.

Description: The description details the proposal for the feature, including syntax for accessing map values, checking the existence of elements, and performing slicing operations. The discussion is about enhancing the query language's capabilities for working with collections (maps, sets, lists) efficiently.

Comments: The comments provide additional insights and suggestions for the proposed feature. They discuss the use of user-defined functions (UDFs) and the potential optimizations for handling the new operations on collections. The comments focus on improving the feature's implementation and performance, but there is no mention of architectural issues or technical debt.

In summary, this issue is about enhancing the query language to work with collections efficiently and does not involve architectural concerns or technical debt in the software's design.

This is an example of a bug issue in the context of a software development project. Let's break down the key information within this bug issue:

Issue Type: The issue is classified as a "Bug," which indicates that it represents an unexpected or unintended behavior in the software.

Summary: The summary provides a brief description of the bug. In this case, it relates to a problem with the reuse of a metadata collector, which can result in an incorrect key count calculation.

Description: The description provides a more detailed explanation of the bug. It describes the scenario where a metadata collector is reused during the flushing of a memtable. However, if the data is split into multiple SSTables, the cardinality estimation component within the reused metadata collector accumulates data from all of them. This leads to overestimated key counts when compacting these SSTables.

Status: The status of the issue is "Open," indicating that it has been identified but not yet resolved.

Comments: The comments section contains a discussion related to the bug. Contributors discuss the impact of the bug and its relevance to different implementations of SSTable writers. They acknowledge that this bug might not affect the current implementations but highlight that it's something to be aware of and potentially fix when a compaction strategy necessitates splitting the flush output.

In software development, bug issues like this one are essential to maintain the quality and reliability of the software. Issue trackers help developers identify, track, and address such problems, and the comments section allows for collaborative discussions on how to resolve the issue. The status "Open" indicates that the bug is acknowledged, and the development team will work on a solution to fix it.

# Stage 3 - Data Preparation:

We generated individual .txt files for each of the 100 issues selected for manual inspection. Each file should contain detailed issue information, including issue ID, type, status, summary, description, and comments. We saved the results of these manual inspections in 100 separate .txt files to be evaluated in other stage.

# Stage 4 - ChatGPT Inspection:

We utilized ChatGPT to inspect each of the 100 .txt files representing issues. The primary goal is to identify potential architectural impacts, architectural issues, and/or technical debt within the analyzed issues. Also we requested justification for each inspection. Finally, we saved the results of these ChatGPT inspections in 100 separate .txt files to be evaluated in other stage.

# Stage 5 - Manual Review:

Finally, in the last stage we conducted a manual review of all 100 sets of inspection results (.txt files) generated by ChatGPT. Ensure that ChatGPT's responses are well-founded and align with the actual content and context of the issues. This stage serves as a quality control measure to validate the accuracy of ChatGPT's classifications.
